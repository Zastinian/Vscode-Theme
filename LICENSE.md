the beginning of the LICENSE for an MIT Licensed project would be:

When including third party open source code in a project, any third party
copyright notices should be preserved with the code. It is good practise
to also surface any third party notices required in your project
into a file called NOTICE.md (or ThirdPartyNotices.txt) in the project root.

## File Headers

The following file header format is the used for .NET Foundation projects.
Please use it for new files and update the headers of existing code files as
appropriate. Note that the general copyright notice for the project is given
in the project's LICENSE file but any third party copyright notices should be
preserved.
